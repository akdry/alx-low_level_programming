## Tasks

[![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-13%2F13-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

This directory contains several C programs that I have created. Below is a list of the programs and a brief description of what each one does.

- [0-positive_or_negative.c](0-positive_or_negative.c) - Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- [1-last_digit.c](1-last_digit.c) - Prints the last digit of a number.
- [2-print_alphabet.c](2-print_alphabet.c) - Prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- [3-print_alphabets.c](3-print_alphabets.c) - Prints the alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase.
- [4-print_alphabt.c](4-print_alphabt.c) - Prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters q and e.
- [5-print_numbers.c](5-print_numbers.c) - Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.
- [6-print_numberz.c](6-print_numberz.c) - Prints all single digit numbers, You can only use the putchar function.
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](7-print_tebahpla.c) - Prints the alphabet in reverse order, in lowercase.
- [8-print_base16.c](8-print_base16.c) - Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- [9-print_comb.c](9-print_comb.c) - Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- [100-print_comb3.c](100-print_comb3.c) - Prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers, without repeating digits.
- [101-print_comb4.c](101-print_comb4.c) - Prints all possible combinations of three-digit numbers, without repeating digits.
- [102-print_comb5.c](102-print_comb5.c) - Prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, without repeating digits.
